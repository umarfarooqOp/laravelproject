      <h3>Our Instructors</h3>
<p>Tayyibun Institute understands that having knowledge of a matter or subject does not necessarily entitle one to teach within that field, therefore together with advice from learned scholars we have developed a training programme to prepare tutors with the adequate knowledge and to equip them with the necessary skills- a rigorous training that only the most committed teachers will pass.We make it a requirement for our teachers to have a certificate within the areas of Tajweed or the Arabic language itself. Our teachers are not only selected for their knowledge, but also for their interpersonal and communication skills- we at Tayyibun see that as a matter of standard should our teachers fail then we ourselves have failed also. All our tutors have experience of teaching Arabic Language and Qur’an to English speaking students from across the Muslim Middle East  and Britain, many have additional specialist qualifications in a wide range of professional fields.</p>
